 * AJAX Extra plugin for jQuery
 * 
 * This plugin enhances the jQuery AJAX request handler with the ability to display a user-specified progress indicator if the request takes longer
 * than a user-specified time to complete. The motivation for adding such functionality is that sometimes the AJAX requests take longer than
 * expected (especially on mobiles with patchy connections) and it would be good to be able to inform the user of such a delay in an
 * easily re-usable manner.
 *
 * Once enabled two new settings are available for the $.ajax call:
 *
 *    'progress_indicator'  - either a jQuery object, function callback or a HTML string specifying the progress indicator. If not specified then no
 *                                      progress indicator will be shown.
 *    'progress_show_delay' - no. of milliseconds to wait from when the AJAX request has been sent before displaying the progress
 *                                  indicator. Default is 1000, i.e. 1 second.
 *
 * The progress indicator can be one of the three types:
 *
 *      jQuery object:        show() will be called on it when the request is in progress and hide() will be called on it once the request completes.
 *
 *      Callback function:   it will be invoked with its argument as false (boolean) when the request is in progress and it will then be invoked with
 *                                  true (boolean) when the request has completed.
 *
 *      HTML string:          it will be added to the body within a DIV when the request is in progress. The DIV will then be removed once the
 *                                  request has completed. The DIV has the 'ajax_progress_indicator' class set on it so you can style it as you wish using
 *                                  CSS.
